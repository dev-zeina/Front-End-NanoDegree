###### Dear Me,

I know you are now **struggling** and face problems but remember when you 
start your NanoDegree

the growth mindset strategy and problem-solving  technique you already 
learned :

 

* take a break :sleeping:

* when you are facing coding problem learn to debug and trace the errors 

   * [use Google!](http://google.com)

   * [ stay connected to your best friend!](http://stackoverflow.com)

* ask community and developers around you  :two_men_holding_hands:  
:two_women_holding_hands:

* draw to look at the whole picture and then start thinking about solutions 
   :black_nib:	 :pencil2:	 :straight_ruler: :triangular_ruler: :bar_chart:

* be resourceful :school_satchel:  :bookmark_tabs:  :books: 

programming is about solving problems by the time your will be better 
problem solver :unlock:

be __patient__ and __positive__  :key:

you only know your *weaknesses* and *goals* better than anyone  

focus on your *goals* and push yourself to the limit 

As growth mindset, you learn 

> mistakes are your   :arrow_forward:  learning opportunites 

> being wrong mean  :arrow_forward:  you are not right yet 

keep going :muscle:
